"body" : "About SwaggerHub SwaggerHub is a collaborative platform where you can define your APIs using the OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specifications and manage your APIs throughout their lifecycle. SwaggerHub is brought to you by the same people behind the open-source Swagger tools. It integrates the core Swagger tools (UI, Editor, Codegen, Validator) into a single platform to help you coordinate the entire workflow of an API’s lifecycle. With SwaggerHub, you can: Define your APIs in the OpenAPI or AsyncAPI format. Host all your API definitions in a single place. Store your common API components (such as data models and responses) in domains and reference them from API definitions. Collaborate on API definitions with your team. For OpenAPI: Generate server and client code and push it to GitHub , GitLab , Bitbucket , or Azure DevOps Services . Share your APIs publicly and privately. Iterate your API design and manage multiple API versions. Compatibility SwaggerHub supports: OpenAPI 2.0 OpenAPI 3.0 OpenAPI 3.1 AsyncAPI 2.x New to API Specifications? Check out these guides to learn how to write API definitions: OpenAPI 3.1 syntax guide OpenAPI 3.0 syntax guide OpenAPI 2.0 syntax guide AsyncAPI Getting Started Guide " },

Learn how to unsubscribe to notifications here . System-wide permissions have changed , so consumer users may find that their access is more restrictive. Click here for more information about current resource roles. If you are a collaborator on APIs or domains in SwaggerHub the organization(s) associated with those resources will now appear in the left sidebar. To find the owner of this organization, click here . Changes to user roles and resource access management: Editor\/Viewer\/Commenter collaborator roles have been replaced by Designer\/Consumer roles. Consumers who are members of a team will be upgraded to designers if the team is added to a resource or project with the designer role. If there are insufficient designer license seats available you will not be able to grant the role change to the team. User billing counts on the Members page have been updated to reflect roles more accurately. Updated Member Profile page for adding roles to members. Previously, invited members were assigned a role which used a designer or consumer seat after they accepted their invitation; now invitations automatically take up a seat (i.e., you can't issue more invitations than the limit count in your plan). Invited users are automatically assigned a consumer role. After sending the invitation, the organization owner can change the assigned role to designer in the organization Member Profile page. Invitations do not expire. If the user does not accept the invitation, they can be removed from the member list so that their seat can be used for another user. Note that the Resend Invitation icon will only appear with invitees who have not accepted their invitation through the automatic invitation flow. The system-wide option checkboxes on the Members page have been redone. Users who previously had a consumer role may find that their permissions have changed. Notifications about all resources (APIs, domains, templates) available to a team are now sent to every member of the team. Collaborators (users who are not members of teams, with access to specific resources) now appear on the member list in Organization Settings. All icons in the updated access control screens have tooltips and you can hover over the icon to get a description of the icon's function. Updated Codegen to 3.0.37 Updated Swagger Core to 2.2.8 " },

"body" : "Working with Others - SaaS This page describes sharing in SaaS. For working with others in On-Premise installations, click here . This page introduces SwaggerHub's access control and sharing for SaaS users. To perform the steps in this tutorial, you need to be an owner of your SwaggerHub account. Overview An organization in SwaggerHub is the collection of members (users) and resources that belongs to an account. For all account plans, the organization has an owner (or multiple owners\/administrators) who manages users and resource access. For online (SaaS) users, typically only one organization is available. On-Premise installations may have multiple organizations. Personal plans have only a single user – click here to explore adding users . There are three kinds of resource files: API definition files Domains (shared libraries of API components) API Custom Templates (API definitions that can be used as a basis for new APIs) APIs and domains can be grouped into: Projects (folders) or accessed individually. SwaggerHub allows resources and projects to be shared within your organization. There are roles: Designers have full access to all features of designing and testing API definition files Owners are a special type of designer who can also create\/manage users, teams, projects and template files Consumers can review API definition files and optionally comment For access purposes, users can be grouped into: Teams of members and non-members who work on the same set of resources Only the owner\/administrator of an organization can: Create organizations (usually only On-Premise accounts have multiple organizations) and modify their settings Add users\/members to an organization (issue invitations) Create and manage teams of users Create and manage projects (groups of resources), including access by individual members and teams Create and manage API custom templates Designers can: Create and update APIs and domains, configure codegen options, generate client and server code Share resources with members and teams (issue invitations) Consumers can: Review APIs and domains Comment (if allowed) Collaborators A special category of user is counted separately in organizations: collaborators. Collaborators are organization members that can only be provided access to individual resources. Collaborators can be either designers or consumers, and they must be invited separately to specific resource files. See Also Getting Started Sharing APIs " },

Check out the Getting Started guide if you are new to creating APIs on SwaggerHub. Click , select Create New API and choose your organization from the Owner list: Various stakeholders manage different pieces of the development process of an API. Every API starts with understanding the requirements. Is this a private API to be used internally by the company to build better software, or is it a public-facing API that could be used to drive the market forward and raise awareness of the company’s products and services? Depending on the requirements set forth by the product owners and technical leads, the API would identify the need for APIs, be it public or private. SwaggerHub lets owners define the visibility of an API directly in the SwaggerHub Editor : Private APIs are usually spearheaded by technical leads and development managers that recognize the need for an internal API to ease the development process of other applications within the organization. Product owners, marketing managers and technical leads usually lead the discussion for public APIs which are open to the masses for consumption. It is only when the vision, purpose and technology for the API are fully explored and set, can the API design and development team help make it a reality. " },

In this tutorial, we will write an API definition in the Swagger 2.0 format (also known as OpenAPI 2.0 ).

Specification – Choose the API format: OpenAPI 2.0, OpenAPI 3.0 or AsyncAPI. Note: OpenAPI 3.0 support has some limitations , AsyncAPI also has limitations . Template – For OpenAPI: Select a template API, such as Petstore or IOT (Internet of Things), or select None to start with a blank API. If you have defined API custom templates, those will appear in the pulldown, and you can choose them. Name – The API name is its unique ID and is part of its path on SwaggerHub, as in https:\/\/app.swaggerhub.com\/api\/{owner}\/ petstore \/1.0 . Requirements: 3 to 60 characters long allowed characters: A..Z a..z 0..9 - _. must start and end with a letter or digit Note that API names are case-sensitive, so petstore and PetStore are two different APIs. Visibility – Choose whether to make the API public or private . Public APIs are visible to anyone, even to people without a SwaggerHub account. Private APIs can be accessed only by owners and by those added as designers or consumers ). You can change the API visibility later if needed. Auto Mock API – If selected, SwaggerHub will automatically create an API mock with the base path https:\/\/virtserver.swaggerhub.com\/{owner}\/{api}\/{version}. This will let you test your API when designing it, and will let developers start working on the client application without having to wait until the API functionality is implemented. SwaggerHub will also create the API Auto Mocking integration for your new API that will automatically update the mock every time you save the API. For more information on using mocks, see API Auto Mocking . When creating a blank API (no template), you also need to specify the following fields: Version – The API version. For example, 1.0 , 1.0.0 , 1.0b5 , beta . See Version Format . Title – The API title that is displayed in the interactive API docs. For example, Pet Store API . Description – An overview of what your API is for. The description will be included in the API definition and displayed in search results in SwaggerHub. You can change the description later.

"body" : "Creating an API Custom Template Availability: Enterprise and Trial plans, SaaS and On-premise API Custom templates are API definitions that you create for use as templates by your organization. Only organization owners can create API custom templates. API custom templates will appear in the Template pulldown when your organization's designers create new APIs. API custom templates behave in exactly the same way as the built-in templates (e.g., PetStore). When designers\/developers create a new API, the template's contents are initially copied into the current API file. APIs created using templates are not linked to their template -- once an API is created and the template is copied, changes to the template are NOT reflected in the created API file. The standard API templates included with SwaggerHub are only available to copy into newly created API files – the templates themselves cannot be changed or revised. However, since you own the definition files of your own API custom templates, they can be edited, renamed, deleted, tested, revised, forked, etc., just like any other API. A custom template can be updated and versioned like any other API definition. It can be public or private. It can be published or not. It can refer to a domain (where supported). You cannot generate code from an API custom template, and templates would not normally be actively used as APIs themselves. " },

You can use this functionality to use some existing specification as a starting point for your API spec, or you can create a copy to experiment with changes without affecting the original spec. To use this functionality, you must be an owner of the original API or you must be a designer for it. The new API can belong to your personal account or any organization you created. Notes The “Save as New” command does not copy integrations , versions and comments in the original API. Also, it does not copy the user permissions defined in the original API. Forking is another way of creating a new API based on some existing API. The difference between these approaches is that you can use “Save as New” only for the APIs which you can edit.

The items that exist in API Gateway but are not defined in SwaggerHub will not be changed. overwrite – (Recommended) Overwrite the existing API in API Gateway with the definition from SwaggerHub. Base Path Mode – This option has effect if the API base path differs from \/ , for example: # OpenAPI 3.0\nservers:\n - url: https:\/\/example.com\/api\/v2 # Base path is \/api\/v2\n\n# OpenAPI 2.0\nbasePath: \/api\/v2 This option specifies whether to create API Gateway resource paths (endpoints) with or without the base path. The options are: ignore prepend split Refer to the API Gateway documentation to learn how these options work. If the base path is \/ or is not provided, use ignore . If an OpenAPI 3.0 definition contains multiple servers , the integration uses the base path of the first server. Update definition with extensions – This option affects the way the integration handles the changes in your API definition, such as new parameters or renamed paths. Disabled – The request and response mappings in API Gateway will be updated automatically based on the current paths and parameters in your API definition. API Gateway extensions ( x-amazon-gateway-* ) will not be added to your API definition, but if they exist, SwaggerHub will create mappings based on these extensions. Enabled – SwaggerHub will add the x-amazon-gateway-* extensions to your API definition that contains the request and response mappings for API Gateway, and the integration will create mappings based on these extensions. Note that the extensions are never updated once they are created. For example, added or changed parameters will not be reflected here. To update the extensions (and the corresponding mappings in API Gateway), you will have to delete the extensions and save your API definition so that SwaggerHub can recreate them. If this option is enabled, SwaggerHub may also make changes to the API definition to make it compliant with the Amazon API Gateway limitations. This includes disabling the example and readOnly properties, removing xml keys, and simplifying model definition names. Disabled features will be wrapped into the x-disabled-for-amazon-gateway extension property. Deployment Mode – Must be on save . Here, “deployment” refers to the action of pushing the definition to API Gateway (it doesn’t refer to the AWS “Deploy API” action). Address of the Server to Proxy to – The back-end HTTP(S) endpoint to which API Gateway will proxy the requests. Do not add a forward slash at the end. Correct: http:\/\/api.example.com\/reports\/v2\nhttps:\/\/myapi.com Incorrect: https:\/\/myapi.com\/ Typically, this should be the same value as the API base path specified in your API definition, that is, the server url in OpenAPI 3.0 or scheme:\/\/host\/basePath in OpenAPI 2.0.

Only unpublished APIs can be integrated with Amazon API Gateway. Make sure the API definition meets AWS requirements ( see above ). Click the API name, switch to the Integrations tab, and click Add New Integrations : Select Amazon API Gateway Lambda Sync from the list of integrations. Enter integration parameters: Name – A display name for this integration, for example, aws lambda sync . AWS Region – Select the AWS region where you want to publish your API or that contains the existing API you want to publish to. API ID – Leave it blank to create a new API in API Gateway. Alternatively, if you want to update an existing API in API Gateway, specify the API ID here or in the x-aws-api-id key at the root level of your API definition. You can find API IDs on the APIs dashboard in the API Gateway console. Click the image to enlarge it. Publish Mode – Choose how to handle existing APIs in API Gateway: merge –Merge changes: add new changes made in SwaggerHub to API Gateway. This can be useful, for example, if your API in API Gateway is split into multiple parts in SwaggerHub, and you want only to synchronize the changes in one of these parts. The items that exist in API Gateway but are not defined in SwaggerHub will not be changed. overwrite – (Recommended) Overwrite the existing API in API Gateway with the definition from SwaggerHub. Base Path Mode – Choose how API Gateway should interpret the basePath property of your API definition. The options are ignore , prepend or split . To learn how these options work, see Set the OpenAPI basePath Property in API Gateway documentation. Update definition with extensions – This option affects the way the integration handles the changes in your API definition, such as new parameters or renamed paths. Disabled – The request and response mappings in API Gateway will be updated automatically based on the current paths and parameters in your API definition. API Gateway extensions ( x-amazon-gateway-* ) will not be added to your API definition, but if they exist, SwaggerHub will create mappings based on these extensions. Enabled – SwaggerHub will add the x-amazon-gateway-* extensions to your API definition that contains the request and response mappings for API Gateway, and the integration will create mappings based on these extensions. Note that the extensions are never updated once they are created. For example, added or changed parameters will not be reflected here. To update the extensions (and the corresponding mappings in API Gateway), you will have to delete the extensions and save your API definition so that SwaggerHub can recreate them. If this option is enabled, SwaggerHub may also make changes to the API definition to make it compliant with the Amazon API Gateway limitations . This includes disabling the example and readOnly properties, removing xml keys, and simplifying model definition names. Disabled features will be wrapped into the x-disabled-for-amazon-gateway extension property. Deployment Mode – Must be on save . Here, “deployment” refers to the action of pushing the definition to API Gateway (it doesn’t refer to the AWS “Deploy API” action). Execution role for creating non-existing Lambda functions –The default execution role that will be assigned to new Lambda functions created by SwaggerHub. Specify the role ARN, it looks like arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role\/{role-name} . The existing functions and their roles will not be changed, SwaggerHub will create only the missing functions. If all Lambda functions already exist and you are not going to recreate them, leave this field blank. Runtime – The programming language for the generated Lambda functions. The supported runtimes are: Node.js 18.x Node.js 16.x Node.js 14.x Node.js 12.x Python 3.9 Python 3.8 Python 3.7 Python 3.6 AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Keys – The keys required to authorize SwaggerHub to connect to Amazon API Gateway. See above . Enable – Enables or disables the integration. Click Create and Execute . SwaggerHub will publish your API definition to API Gateway and will create Lambda functions for all operations.

Rate limit: 10 requests per minute per API version, though sometimes, you may experience a higher throughput. After the limit is reached, you will get a 429 (Too Many Requests) response to subsequent requests. If you need a higher rate limit, consider using SwaggerHub On-Premise, which does not have a rate limit for mock requests. The mock is powered by SmartBear VirtServer, which is part of SmartBear ReadyAPI . Note that the mock does not support business logic, that is, it cannot send specific responses based on the input.

The proxy in Edge will be given a new revision every time you save the API in SwaggerHub. New revisions are not deployed automatically. To activate the changes, you will have to go back to the Edge console and deploy the new revision manually. The procedure is explained below . The integration is one-way, meaning your API definitions go from SwaggerHub to Apigee Edge, but not vice versa. You should edit your API definitions in SwaggerHub only. The integration is tied to a specific version of an API. If your API has multiple versions, you can configure the integrations separately for different versions, provided that these versions have different basePath values. " },

If a proxy does not exist in Edge, it will be created, and then a new revision of the proxy will be created upon each save. The proxy name is saved in the x-apigee-id key at the root level of your API definition. The proxy serves as a management layer in front of your existing backend API and allows you to attach various policies to manage the traffic, add authentication, transform the payload and so on. These policies are configured in the Edge console. Note that new revisions of the proxy will not inherit the policies of previous revisions, so you will have to re-configure the policies manually for new revisions of the proxy. After configuring the proxy, you can deploy it to the production or test environment in Edge. The integration does not deploy the proxy automatically. This must be done manually and repeated whenever you update your API definition in SwaggerHub. A deployed proxy has a public-facing URL in the format http(s):\/\/{orgname}-{environment}.apigee.net\/{basePath} that the API clients can use to access the API.

Note: In SwaggerHub On-Premise versions up to 1.23.1, Basic Sync always pushes to the branch named SWAGGERHUB . To use a different branch, select Advanced Sync or upgrade your SwaggerHub On-Premise instance to the latest version. Advanced Sync Similar to Basic Sync, but you can specify which files will be overwritten or ignored. Use this method if the output folder contains existing files that you want to keep. Branch – Required. The repository branch to push the code to. If this branch does not exist, it will be created based on the repository’s default branch. Generated API Code – Required. Select what you want to generate: server code, client SDK, API documentation, or the OpenAPI definition itself as YAML or JSON. See here for a list of supported languages and frameworks. To customize code generation options, such as package names, use the Export > Codegen Options menu in the SwaggerHub editor. See Code Generation Options for details. Output Folder – The output folder for the generated code, relative to the repository root. For example, server or sdk\/android . If this folder does not exist, it will be created. If the output folder is not specified, SwaggerHub will create files and folders in the repository root. Use forward slashes ( \/ ) as path separators: folder\/subfolder1\/subfolder2 – Correct folder\\subfolder1\\subfolder2 – Incorrect Paths – Available only if you selected Advanced Sync . Use these options to control which files and folders will be created, updated, deleted, or ignored during synchronization. All the paths are relative to the Output Folder . You need to specify either Partially Managed Paths or Fully Managed Paths . Partially Managed Paths – These files and folders will be created if they do not exist, but the existing files and folders will not be modified. The wildcard * indicates all files and folders in the Output Folder . Fully Managed Paths – These files and folders will be completely managed by the integration: new files will be added, the existing files will be overwritten, and the files that are no longer used will be deleted.

Note: In SwaggerHub On-Premise versions up to 1.23.1, Basic Sync always pushes to the branch named SWAGGERHUB . To use a different branch, select Advanced Sync or upgrade your SwaggerHub On-Premise instance to the latest version. Advanced Sync Similar to Basic Sync, but you can specify which files will be overwritten or ignored. Use this method if the output folder contains existing files that you want to keep. Branch – Required. The repository branch to push the code to. If this branch does not exist, it will be created based on the repository’s default branch. Generated API Code – Required. Select what you want to generate: server code, client SDK, API documentation, or the OpenAPI definition itself as YAML or JSON. See here for a list of supported languages and frameworks. To customize code generation options, such as package names, use the Export > Codegen Options menu in the SwaggerHub editor. See Code Generation Options for details. Output Folder – The output folder for the generated code, relative to the repository root. For example, server or sdk\/android . If this folder does not exist, it will be created. If the output folder is not specified, SwaggerHub will create files and folders in the repository root. Use forward slashes ( \/ ) as path separators: folder\/subfolder1\/subfolder2 – Correct folder\\subfolder1\\subfolder2 – Incorrect Paths – Available only if you selected Advanced Sync . Use these options to control which files and folders will be created, updated, deleted, or ignored during synchronization. All the paths are relative to the Output Folder . You need to specify either Partially Managed Paths or Fully Managed Paths . Partially Managed Paths – These files and folders will be created if they do not exist, but the existing files and folders will not be modified. The wildcard * indicates all files and folders in the Output Folder . Fully Managed Paths – These files and folders will be completely managed by the integration: new files will be added, the existing files will be overwritten, and the files that are no longer used will be deleted. You can use * as a wildcard for all files. Ignored Paths – These files and folders will remain as is and will not be changed in any way.

Note: In SwaggerHub On-Premise versions up to 1.23.1, Basic Sync always pushes to the branch named SWAGGERHUB . To use a different branch, select Advanced Sync or upgrade your SwaggerHub On-Premise instance to the latest version. Advanced Sync Similar to Basic Sync, but you can specify which files will be overwritten or ignored. Use this method if the output folder contains existing files that you want to keep. Branch – Required. The name of the branch in the repository where your API code will be stored. Generated API Code – Required. Select what you want to generate: server code, client SDK, API documentation, or the OpenAPI definition itself as YAML or JSON. See here for a list of supported languages and frameworks. To customize code generation options, such as package names, use the Export > Codegen Options menu in the SwaggerHub editor. See Code Generation Options for details. Output Folder – The output folder for the generated code, relative to the repository root. For example, server or sdk\/android . If this folder does not exist, it will be created. If the output folder is not specified, SwaggerHub will create files and folders in the repository root. Use forward slashes ( \/ ) as path separators: folder\/subfolder1\/subfolder2 – Correct folder\\subfolder1\\subfolder2 – Incorrect Output file – Only used if Generated API Code is JSON or YAML , that is, the OpenAPI definition itself. Specifies the name of the .json or .yaml file to create, for example, swagger.yaml or petstore.json . This file will be created in the Output Folder . Paths – Available only if you selected Advanced Sync . Use these options to control which files and folders will be created, updated, deleted, or ignored during synchronization. All the paths are relative to the Output Folder . You need to specify either Partially Managed Paths or Fully Managed Paths . Partially Managed Paths – These files and folders will be created if they do not exist, but the existing files and folders will not be modified. The wildcard * indicates all files and folders in the Output Folder . Fully Managed Paths – These files and folders will be completely managed by the integration: new files will be added, the existing files will be overwritten, and the files that are no longer used will be deleted. You can use * as a wildcard for all files. Ignored Paths – These files and folders will remain as is and will not be changed in any way.

In the subsequent dialog, specify the integration parameters: Name – Required. A display name for the integration. GitHub Enterprise Host – The URL of your GitHub Enterprise Server, for example, https:\/\/ghe.mycompany.com . Make sure to include http:\/\/ or https:\/\/ at the beginning. This option is only used in SwaggerHub SaaS. In SwaggerHub On-Premise, the target GitHub Enterprise Server for integrations is specified in the Admin Console . GitHub Enterprise Token (or GitHub Token ) – A personal access token to authenticate with GitHub. You can create this token on the https:\/\/<github-host>\/settings\/tokens page. The token must have the public_repo scope if the target repository is public, or the repo scope if it is private. For detailed instructions, see Creating a personal access token for the command line . Click Next in the GitHub Token edit box to continue. SwaggerHub will validate the token and then display other parameters. Repository Owner – Select the GitHub user or organization that owns the desired repository. The list displays only those accounts your GitHub token has access to. Repository – Select the repository to push the code to. This repository must not be empty. It must contain at least one commit, for example, a README or .gitignore file. Sync Method – Select the synchronization type: Sync method Description Basic Sync SwaggerHub will manage all files in the specified branch and folder: new files will be added, existing files will be overwritten, and unused files will be deleted. Note: In SwaggerHub On-Premise versions up to 1.23.1, Basic Sync always pushes to the branch named SWAGGERHUB . To use a different branch, select Advanced Sync or upgrade your SwaggerHub On-Premise instance to the latest version. Advanced Sync Similar to Basic Sync, but you can specify which files will be overwritten or ignored. Use this method if the output folder contains existing files that you want to keep. Branch – Required. The repository branch to push the code to. If this branch does not exist, it will be created based on the repository’s default branch. Generated API Code – Required. Select what you want to generate: server code, client SDK, API documentation, or the OpenAPI definition itself as YAML or JSON. See here for a list of supported languages and frameworks. To customize code generation options, such as package names, use the Export > Codegen Options menu in the SwaggerHub editor. See Code Generation Options for details. Output Folder – The output folder for the generated code, relative to the repository root. For example, server or sdk\/android . If this folder does not exist, it will be created. If the output folder is not specified, SwaggerHub will create files and folders in the repository root. Use forward slashes ( \/ ) as path separators: folder\/subfolder1\/subfolder2 – Correct folder\\subfolder1\\subfolder2 – Incorrect Paths – Available only if you selected Advanced Sync . Use these options to control which files and folders will be created, updated, deleted, or ignored during synchronization. All the paths are relative to the Output Folder . You need to specify either Partially Managed Paths or Fully Managed Paths . Partially Managed Paths – These files and folders will be created if they do not exist, but the existing files and folders will not be modified. The wildcard * indicates all files and folders in the Output Folder . Fully Managed Paths – These files and folders will be completely managed by the integration: new files will be added, the existing files will be overwritten, and the files that are no longer used will be deleted. You can use * as a wildcard for all files. Ignored Paths – These files and folders will remain as is and will not be changed in any way. Use forward slashes ( \/ ) as path separators, for example, sdk\/android\/README.md . Output file – Only used if Generated API Code is JSON or YAML , that is, the OpenAPI definition itself. Specifies the name of the .json or .yaml file to create, for example, swagger.yaml or petstore.json . This file will be created in the Output Folder .

OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 definitions use a slightly different structure and keywords, so some validations may need separate rules for different OpenAPI versions. Rule Severity Error or Warning . Errors will prevent the API from being published if the Require API to pass Standardization to be publishable option is selected in the Standardization settings. Error Message An optional additional error message displayed in the SwaggerHub editor , up to 130 chars. If omitted, the rule name is used as the error message. If both the name and the error message are specified, the name will prefix the error message. For example, given: Rule name: Version Error message: `info.version` must be major.minor.patch the full error message in the editor will be: Version -> `info.version` must be major.minor.patch Path Required A JSONPath expression that specifies the target node or nodes to check. For example, $.info.version . Case-sensitive. We use the jsonpath-plus library that supports some extra selectors in addition to the standard JSONPath syntax. See the jsonpath-plus documentation for the supported syntax. Test For Specify pattern to search for the regular expression specified in the Pattern field (below). Alternately, you can choose defined to to check that the node is present, regardless of the value. For example, check that tag objects have a description specified. See also How \"defined\" rules work below. Field Field to be tested. Set this to @key if you want to test against a field name rather than a value. Pattern A regular expression to test against the result of the specified JSONPath. For example, ^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$ . Notes: This option is available if the defined option is not selected in the Test For field. If the path expression returns an array, each array item is tested against this regular expression. Patterns look for a partial match unless the pattern contains the ^ (beginning of value) and $ (end of value) anchors. For example, a matches any string that contains this character, but ^a$ matches the exact string \"a\". Patterns are case-sensitive by default. For a case-insensitive match, use the format \/pattern\/i , for example, \/https\/i . Must Match Regular expression match type: \"must match\" (check box is selected) or \"must not match\" (unselected). Try It Out Use this section to test the rule against an existing API. You can either paste the API definition into the Try It Out field or use the IMPORT API button to import an API into the Try It Out field for testing purposes. Save Save the rule. " },

The specified JSONPath expression is first split into two components: the last component (the target key name) and everything that precedes it (let's call this \"base path\"). SwaggerHub then finds all the nodes with the \"base path\" and checks whether each of them contains the target key. The nodes that do not contain this key will fail the validation.

Note that a match can be a standalone value, a simple key: value node, an array, or a multi-property object (including nested objects). The error and warning icons in the gutter indicate the nodes that failed the validation. The results may look differently depending on whether you test a \"defined\" rule or a pattern-based rule.

"body" : "This information applies to SwaggerHub SaaS. You can change your billing plan at any time. If you change the plan in the middle of the billing period, we will recalculate your payment for this period based on the number of passed and remaining days, so that you pay only for the actual days you spent on the old plan. The remainder will count towards the first payment on the new plan. The billing engine counts full days and rounds up to the nearest full day (that is, the current day is considered passed). A day is defined as beginning at 12 AM (midnight) Irish time . Example 1 Suppose, you are upgrading your plan: Old plan New plan Days of the billing period passed $120\/month $330\/month 20 days In this case, you will get a $40 discount for the first payment for the new plan: $120\/30 * 20 = $80 <– The price for the past 20 days on the old plan (in this example, we assume there are 30 days in the month). $120 - $80 = $40 <– Your credit for the next payment. $330 - $40 = $290 <– Your first payment on the new plan. The invoice will reflect the proration: Example 2 Suppose now that you are changing from a more expensive plan to a cheaper one: Old plan New plan Days of the billing period passed $330\/month $120\/month 20 days In this case: $330\/30 * 20 = $220 <– The price for the passed 20 days on the old plan (we assume there are 30 days in the month). $330 - $220 = $110 <– Your credit for the next payment. $120 - $110 = $10 <– Your first payment on the new plan. Example 3 One more example. Consider this change: Old plan New plan Days of the billing period passed $330\/month $120\/month 10 days You will get the following discount: $330\/30 * 10 = $110 <– The price for the past 10 days on the old plan. $330 - $110 = $220 <– Your credit for the next payment. As you can see, the credit you have covers the first payment on the new plan completely. So, the first payment will be $0 for you. The rest $100 ( $220 - $120 = $100 ) will be applied to the second payment on the new plan. That is, the second payment will be $120 - $100 = $20 only. In other words, the credit you get when changing the plan will be applied to further payments until it decreases to 0. Changing both billing plan and period You can also change both the billing period and the plan. We will calculate the new payment using the same proration principle: your last payment on the old plan will be re-calculated based on how many days passed, and the remainder will be applied to the new payment (or payments) as described above.

"body" : "Updated on February 28, 2022 We have released SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.29.2 and 2.0.0 with Log4j updated to v. 2.17.1. Updated on December 16, 2021 An updated security patch is available for SwaggerHub On-Premise versions 1.29, 1.28, and 1.27 that addresses the recently disclosed vulnerabilities in the Apache Log4j library, CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) and CVE-2021-45046 . This patch supersedes the previous patch published on December 13. While SwaggerHub On-Premise does not use Log4j directly, this library is used by the bundled Elasticsearch and VirtServer components. The patch updates these components to the versions that provide mitigations for the mentioned CVEs. Specifically, Elasticsearch is updated to version 7.16.1 , and VirtServer is updated to use Log4j version 2.16.0 . Customers running SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.26 and earlier versions must upgrade to at least v. 1.27 in order to apply this patch (as per our End-of-Support Policy ). Important: If you upgrade an already patched 1.27 or 1.28 instance to a later version, you will need to apply this patch again after the upgrade. If you rehydrate your instance, you will need to apply this patch to the new instance. Download the patch (740 MB): https:\/\/onprem-files.s3.amazonaws.com\/log4j-patch.enc The patch is standalone, so it can be installed on offline instances too. Steps to apply the patch: Upload and run the patch on the System tab of the Admin Center, as explained here . Note: Since the patch file size is large, it will take a few minutes to upload to the Admin Center, and a few more minutes to execute. If you have a load balancer in front of your SwaggerHub On-Premise instance, you may need to increase the load balancer timeout so that the file upload does not time out. Wait for the following output to appear: ******************************************************************\nThe patch for CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 has been applied.\nPlease restart SwaggerHub to apply the changes.\n****************************************************************** Restart SwaggerHub for the changes to take effect. To verify the mitigation, check the component versions on the System Status page of the Admin Center. The version of swaggerhub_SWAGGERHUB-VIRTSERVER_1 should be 3.8.1, and the version of swaggerhub_ELASTIC-SEARCH_1 should be 7.16.1. This patch does not change the SwaggerHub version number. " },

Going forward, offline upgrade can be done by copying the upgrade bundle directly to the SwaggerHub VM and changing the Software Update URL to file:\/\/\/path\/to\/swaggerhub-offline-images.zip . User Management API improvements New operations to help admins and organization owners manage users: PATCH \/orgs\/{orgId}\/members - Change the organization role for one or more members: curl -X PATCH http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/orgs\/ORG_NAME\/members \\\n -H 'Authorization: API_KEY' \\\n -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\\n -d '{\"members\": [ \\\n { \"email\": \"bob@example.com\", \"role\": \"DESIGNER\" }, \\\n { \"email\": \"amy@example.com\", \"role\": \"OWNER\" } \\\n ]}' DELETE \/orgs\/{orgId}\/members - Delete one or more users from an organization. The user accounts remain in the system. curl -X DELETE \"http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/orgs\/ORG_NAME\/members?user=bob@example.com&user=amy@example.com\" -H \"Authorization: API_KEY\" DELETE \/users - Delete one or more user accounts from SwaggerHub On-Premise (requires the admin’s API key): curl -X DELETE \"http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/users?user=bob@example.com&user=amy@example.com\" -H \"Authorization: ADMIN_API_KEY\" Get the last activity date of organization members. The response from GET \/orgs\/{orgId}\/members includes a new lastActive property that contains the date and time of the last activity of organization members. Tracked activities include logins and changes made to data. The updated OpenAPI definition for the User Management API can be found here: ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/swagger.yaml - the YAML version ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/swagger.json - the JSON version Registry API now uses OpenAPI 3.0 The Registry API definition is now available in the OpenAPI 3.0 format. It can be found here: ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/openapi.yaml - the YAML version ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/openapi.json - the JSON version The OpenAPI 2.0 version is still available but is considered deprecated. ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/swagger.yaml ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/swagger.json Going forward, new operations will be added to the OpenAPI 3.0 version only. Organization improvements Organization invitations sent to unregistered users now expire after 90 days if the user has not signed up within that period. Invitees whose invitation has expired are automatically removed from the organization’s member list, but you can invite them again. Some organization-related pages have been redesigned to improve the user experience. The My Organizations page now displays the email addresses of all organization owners along with the \"send email\" buttons. You can also navigate to the organization’s API catalog by clicking View APIs & Domains . The Organization Overview page now displays the current number of Designers, Consumers, APIs, and Domains in the organization. Other changes Updated Swagger UI to v. 3.52.0, which supports file uploading for binary request bodies in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions. Updated Swagger Editor to v. 3.18.1. Updated Swagger Codegen to v. 3.0.27 for OpenAPI 3.0 and 2.4.21 for OpenAPI 2.0. " },

User Management API improvements Inviting users to organizations via API. Use the new POST \/orgs\/ORG_NAME\/members operation to invite one or more email addresses and, optionally, set the user roles in the organization (default is Consumer). The request must be authenticated using the API key of the admin user or organization owner. The admin can invite users to any organization in the system. curl -X POST http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/orgs\/ORG_NAME\/members \\\n -H 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\\n -d '{\"members\": [ \\\n { \"email\": \"bob@example.com\", \"role\": \"CONSUMER\" }, \\\n { \"email\": \"amy@example.com\", \"role\": \"DESIGNER\" } \\\n ]}' The updated OpenAPI definition for the User Management API can be found here: ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/swagger.yaml - YAML version ⇒ http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/swagger.json - JSON version Configuration improvements New SAML options. The Admin Center includes new options to configure the maximum clock skew and verify the audience in SAML assertions during single sign-on. Improved logging for better troubleshooting: Added logging for custom standardization rules. Added more details for source control integration errors. The upgrade log now also includes information about successful upgrades. Improved error messages when testing connections using the Test Proxy button. Organization improvements The new Team Admin role allows organizations to delegate team management to specific team members. Team admins can add and remove team members, promote others to team admins, or delete the team. Each team can have none or some admins among the Designers in that team. Team admins can view and manage only those teams where they have admin rights, while organization owners can manage all teams. Having the Team Admin role does not change any other permissions outside of the team or in relation to the organization’s APIs. The new audit log event - UPDATE_TEAM_MEMBER - is recorded when the Team Admin role is added to or removed from a team member. Enforce private visibility for organization-owned APIs. Organizations on Enterprise plans have a new option, Allow Designers to make APIs & Domains Public . If this option is disabled, all new APIs, domains, and versions in this organization will be created as private, and only organization owners can make them public. This option does not change the visibility of existing APIs and domains. Invited users are now added to the organization immediately without having to accept the invitation. To reflect this change, the Joined column on the organization members page has been renamed to Confirmed . Unconfirmed users are those who have not created an account in SwaggerHub yet. Email notifications sent to newly added organization members now include the username of the person who added those users. The Team Members page now also displays the email addresses and organization roles of the team members. The email addresses are only visible to organization owners and Team Admins. When adding organization members to a team, you can now look up users by their email addresses in addition to usernames. The organization settings button ( ) is now always displayed to organization owners and team admins in My Hub sidebar. Previously, this button was displayed upon hovering over the organization name. Login and account improvements Login via email. When internal authentication is used, users can now log in using email addresses as an alternative to the username. Unlinking from GitHub. Users who signed up via GitHub or have their SwaggerHub account linked to GitHub can now unlink the GitHub account. The Account Overview page in user settings has been redesigned to improve the user experience. Improved error messages in case of SAML authentication issues. Editor and Interactive Docs improvements Integrity checks for OpenAPI 3.0 domain references. For example, you will now get a warning when trying to publish an API that references unpublished domains. Similarly, you’ll get a warning when making an API public if it references private domains. Previously, these checks were performed for OpenAPI 2.0 domains only. More cURL examples. Interactive API docs now generate cURL command examples not only for Bash but also for PowerShell and Windows CMD. Updated Swagger UI to v. 3.49.0 and Swagger Editor to v. 3.16.2. Other improvements Increased catalog page size. My Hub, organization catalog pages, and search results now show 25 items per page instead of 10 items. The help menu now displays the version number of your SwaggerHub On-Premise instance. Also, we’ve added the Give Feedback link that the logged in users can use to sign up for SwaggerHub UX research. Bundled help pages have been removed and replaced with links to the online documentation so that you can get the most up-to-date information. SwaggerHub pages will now load faster as a result of optimizations in resource loading. End-of-support policy To help ensure that our customers are running versions of SwaggerHub On-Premise that we can most-thoroughly support, we are introducing a new End-of-Support Policy . This isn’t likely to impact you as long as you upgrade to the most recent, most secure versions regularly. " },

Customers are expected to complete the full upgrade including migration to Ubuntu 20. Ubuntu 16-based instances of SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.27 are not eligible for technical support. Future releases will be delivered with Ubuntu 20 only. System enhancements Ubuntu 20. The underlying operating system has been updated to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which is the latest long-term support release. CIS hardening. SwaggerHub On-Premise images for all platforms have been hardened according to the \"Level 1 - Server\" profile of \"CIS Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS Benchmark v1.0.0\". The CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmarks are best practices for the secure configuration of systems. The benchmark is available from the CIS website . The SwaggerHub On-Premise CIS assessment report is available upon request from SmartBear Support . Updated Node.js to v. 14.16.0 LTS. Updated MongoDB to v. 4.4. Configuration improvements New SAML options. The SAML configuration in the Admin Center includes new options to configure the authentication context for SAML requests during single sign-on: Send RequestAuthnContext in the SAML request AuthnContext values RequestedAuthnContext comparison type See SAML 2.0 Settings for more information about these options. User lockout after failed logins. After five failed login attempts, the user account becomes locked for five minutes. This helps protect against brute-force attacks. Enhanced search Full-text search. SwaggerHub On-Premise now searches the entire YAML contents of API definitions and domains. For example, you can search for definitions that contain specific paths, parameters, or schemas. Search using boolean operators. You can combine the search terms using AND, OR, NOT. For example, upload OR submit will find definitions containing either word. New Best Match sorting shows the search results ranked by relevance. This is now the default sort order for search results. See Searching SwaggerHub for more information. Overall improvements OpenAPI 3.0 support in the Amazon API Gateway Lambda Sync integration. Custom standardization rules can now be deleted. Catalog pages and the editor now display long API names and domain names in full. Code generation improvements New server generators for Java: OpenAPI 3.0: jaxrs-cxf, jaxrs-spec OpenAPI 2.0: java-pkmst Updated Swagger Codegen to v. 3.0.25 for OpenAPI 3.0 and v. 2.4.19 for OpenAPI 2.0. Editor and Interactive Docs improvements Interactive API docs now remember the selected server after page refresh. Updated Swagger UI to v. 3.45.0, which includes the following improvements: Support for the OpenID Connect Discovery (OIDC) security scheme. Generating examples for YAML media types. Grouping and sorting parameters by location ( in attribute). Updated Swagger Editor to v 3.15.9. Registry API improvements New operations to manage integrations: Get all integrations configured for a specific API version. Get integration settings. Update integration settings. Run an integration. Delete an integration. New operations to fork APIs and domains. Breaking change: The response of GET \/projects has been updated to use the same Project object as other project-related operations. New response {\n \"offset\": 0,\n \"totalCount\": 1,\n \"projects\": [\n {\n \"name\": \"Project name\",\n \"description\": \"Project description\",\n \"apis\": [\n \"petstore\"\n ],\n \"domains\": [\n \"common-models\"\n ]\n }\n ]\n} Old response {\n \"offset\": 0,\n \"totalCount\": 1,\n \"projects\": [\n {\n \"groupId\": \"MyOrg\",\n \"projectId\": \"Project name\",\n \"name\": \"Project description\",\n \"apis\": [\n {\n \"owner\": \"MyOrg\",\n \"name\": \"petstore\",\n \"version\": \"2.0.0\"\n }\n ],\n \"domains\": [\n {\n \"owner\": \"MyOrg\",\n \"name\": \"common-models\",\n \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n }\n ]\n }\n ]\n} Operations that download API definitions have a new flatten parameter that affects the structure of resolved YAML and JSON. Flattening replaces all inline complex schemas with named entries in the components\/schemas or definitions section. POST \/apis\/{owner}\/{api} and POST \/domains\/{owner}\/{domain} now detect the OpenAPI version (3.0 or 2.0) of uploaded files automatically. Previously, OpenAPI 3.0 uploads required the use of the ?oas=3.0.0 query parameter - this is no longer needed. The oas parameter has been removed and is now ignored.

Integration improvements Pulling API definitions from source control. If you store your OpenAPI definitions in a Git repository, you can now pull them from the repository into SwaggerHub. To be able to do this, you need to configure a source control integration in SwaggerHub with the target file set to an unresolved YAML or JSON definition. This integration will allow bi-directional synchronization (both push and pull) between SwaggerHub and the Git repository. For details, see Syncing API Definitions Between Source Control and SwaggerHub . API mocks and webhooks are now carried over when you create a new version of an API. Azure API Management integration has the new API URL Suffix option to set the base path of your API gateway in Azure, such as https:\/\/{instance}.azure-api.net\/ myApi . Registry API improvements New operations: create and manage projects in organizations, get API standardization errors, add integrations to APIs, get and set the visibility (public or private) of APIs and domains, create new versions of APIs and domains, rename APIs and domains, read, add, and manage comments. The sort parameter of search operations supports a new value, TITLE . The version parameter of the \"create or update a domain\" operation ( POST \/domains\/{owner}\/{domain} ) is now optional. This aligns with the corresponding API-specific operation ( POST \/apis\/{owner}\/{api} ). The following operations have been deprecated in favor of the new commenting operations: GET \/apis\/{owner}\/{api}\/{version}\/.comment\nGET \/domains\/{owner}\/{domain}\/{version}\/.comment Registry API now validates request bodies sent with POST, PUT, and PATCH requests to make sure they conform to the OpenAPI definition. This includes making sure that the required fields are present, all values have the correct data types, and so on. As a result, requests that previously worked without required fields in the body will no longer work and will need to be updated. The updated OpenAPI definition for the Registry API can be found at: http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/swagger.yaml - YAML version\nhttp(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/swagger.json - JSON version CLI compatibility This release adds support for the following commands of SwaggerHub CLI : swaggerhub api:validate - get API standardization errors swaggerhub integration:create - add integrations to an API swaggerhub api:update --visibility=public|private - change API visibility Catalog improvements My Hub, organization and project pages, and the search page have been improved: Catalog pages now have the \"delete\" button so that you can quickly delete APIs and domains you no longer need. APIs and domains can be sorted by their title ( info.title ). Designers and consumers can see their role in the header of organization catalog pages. Editor improvements This release comes with Swagger Editor v. 3.14.6, which includes new syntax validations: Check for path parameters that are defined in the parameters list but not included in the path itself (for example, if a path is defined as \/users instead of \/users\/{id} ). Validate component names in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions. Component names can contain only A-Z a-z 0-9 - . _ Validate that a schema’s default value is present in the enum . Validate schemas in the components\/schemas section in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions. Validate that min* values are less than or equal to the corresponding max* values in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions. Validate that OpenAPI 3.0 parameter references, header references, and requestBody schema references point to the correct component types. Improved syntax validation for domains. The Export > Download API > YAML Resolved and JSON Resolved commands now download the actual YAML or JSON file instead of a ZIP archive. Code generation improvements New code generators: Go and TypeScript Fetch clients for OpenAPI 3.0. C++ (Pistache, Restbed) servers for OpenAPI 2.0. Updated Swagger Codegen to v. 3.0.23 for OpenAPI 3.0 and v. 2.4.17 for OpenAPI 2.0. Interactive Docs improvements New option for \"try it out\" requests: Credentials in CORS requests . This option becomes available when routing requests via browser and corresponds to Swagger UI’s withCredentials option. Set this option based on how CORS is configured on the API server: Enable this option if the API server sends back the origin header, such as Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https:\/\/your.swaggerhub.server.com . Disable this option if the API server sends the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * response header. If this option is disabled, CORS requests will not include browser cookies or the Authorization header. This release comes with Swagger UI v. 3.36.2, which includes the following improvements: Syntax highlighting in request bodies, response bodies, and cURL commands. An option to send or omit optional form fields with empty values. (OpenAPI 3.0) Validate the presence of required form fields before sending requests. (OpenAPI 3.0) A button to copy the \"try it out\" response body to the clipboard. \"Try it out\" support for uploading array of files in multipart\/* requests in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions.

"body" : "Overall improvements Pushing to source control has become easier. SwaggerHub Editor now provides the Push button to trigger source control integrations, which works separately from the Save action. This way, you can save the API definition changes incrementally and only push to the source control repository when ready to do so. You can also provide a custom commit message when pushing the changes. Non-source control integrations – API Auto Mocking and Webhooks – are still triggered on save. Registry API improvements Download resolved API definitions by adding the ?resolved=true query parameter to the URL of the YAML\/JSON file. Resolved YAML: http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/apis\/OWNER\/API_NAME\/VERSION\/swagger.yaml?resolved=true Resolved JSON: http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/apis\/OWNER\/API_NAME\/VERSION?resolved=true\nor\nhttp(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/apis\/OWNER\/API_NAME\/VERSION\/swagger.json?resolved=true Code Editor improvements This release comes with Swagger Editor v. 3.9.0, which includes new syntax checks: Warnings about OpenAPI 3.0 header parameters named Authorization , Content-Type , Accept . The warning messages explain how these headers should be defined instead: The Authorization header should be defined as a security scheme , that is, using the securitySchemes and security keywords. Content-Type is defined using request body media types – requestBody.content.<media-type> . Accept is defined as response media types – responses.<code>.content.<media-type> . Warnings about unused security schemes – that is, OAS2 securityDefinitions and OAS3 securitySchemes that are not used in security . Error messages if an array’s minItems attribute value is greater than maxItems . Schema validation for OpenAPI 3.0 response components in the components\/responses section. Visual Editor improvements You can add new schemas (models) by clicking the “+” button next to the schema list in the Navigation panel: You can delete operations and schemas from the Navigation panel. Interactive Docs improvements This release comes with Swagger UI v. 3.25.4, which includes the following improvements: Display parameter format in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions. Support for Basic authentication with an empty password. Code generation improvements New Rust server generator for OpenAPI 2.0. Configuration changes SwaggerHub On-Premise collects usage data and sends it to SmartBear to help us improve the product. If you wish to opt out, clear the Send usage data check box during installation or later in Admin Center. The Skip Git SSL verification option has been removed. Instead, use the Certificate Manager and the SSL Certificate Trust Chain option to manage trusted SSL certificates. " },

"body" : "Configuration improvements: View users’ last login date . The user list on the License page of the Admin Center now includes the last login date for each user so that administrators can identify inactive users. The last login date is also included in the exported CSV report. Overall improvements: Commenting permissions for Consumers. Organizations have the new option to give Consumers and Designers permissions to comment on all of the organization’s APIs and Domains. This allows Consumers to offer feedback on the API design and ask implementation questions as they consume the API. Improved search. You can now search definitions by partial string match and regular expressions. See Searching SwaggerHub for details. Support for OpenAPI 3.0.3. You can now import API definitions that use openapi: 3.0.3 . Improved browser tab titles for various SwaggerHub pages. The titles now better indicate what is in each tab, making it easier to work with multiple SwaggerHub pages open at the same time. Admin Center colors were updated to match the main SwaggerHub application. Updated dialog box styles. Integration improvements: Source control integrations are now carried over when you create a new version of an API. The branch for the copied integrations will be set to swaggerhub-<API-name>-<version> . You can change the branch name later if you want. The Basic Sync mode of source control integrations now allows custom branch names. AWS Lambda integration now supports newer versions of Node.js and Python. You can choose from: Node.js 12 Node.js 10 Python 3.8 Python 3.7 Python 3.6 Python 2.7 Node.js 4.3 was removed because it is no longer supported by Lambda. If you used this version, you will need to update your integrations to a newer version of Node.js. New supported regions in AWS integrations: ap-east-1 , me-south-1 . Code generation improvements: New Swift 5 client code generator for OpenAPI 3.0. Updated Swagger Codegen to v. 3.0.19 for OpenAPI 3.0 and v. 2.4.13 for OpenAPI 2.0.

Please wait for the restart to complete before you proceed with the actual upgrade. Configuration improvements: You can add custom Terms & Conditions that the users will need to accept before they can create a SwaggerHub account or log in. Improvements to the download process for backups and diagnostic data. The saml:Issuer value in SwaggerHub’s SAML requests has been changed from swaggerhub to http(s):\/\/your_swaggerhub_domain\/login\/callback for better compatibility with SAML identity providers. This change applies only to new installations of v. 1.22.0 and does not affect the actual single sign-on functionality. Editor and Interactive Docs improvements: Support for multiple examples in parameters, request bodies, and responses in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions and domains. OpenAPI 3.0 parameters with content are now displayed and can be used in \"try it out\". Support for permalinks to API models. API model permalinks have the #\/MODEL_NAME format, for example: https:\/\/swaggerhub.mycompany.com\/apis\/orgname\/apiname\/1.0.0#\/User Code Editor and Visual Editor now remember their editor and UI panel sizes independently.

A new Port option to specify the port on which SwaggerHub is externally accessible (if it differs from the default ports 80 and 443). This is used in scenarios with custom port forwarding. Editor and Interactive Docs improvements: Visual Editor lets you easily update your API information, operation metadata, and schema descriptions without having to remember the corresponding OpenAPI YAML markup. You can switch between the Code Editor and Visual Editor by using the sidebar buttons in the SwaggerHub editor. Docs Branding . Organization owners can upload a logo that will be used in consumer-facing documentation. This custom logo will be displayed in all API docs and domain docs of the organization. Domains display additional OpenAPI 3.0 components: request bodies, headers, examples, links, and callbacks. Lazy loading of external $refs. SwaggerHub editor and interactive documentation can now lazily load external $refs such as domain references. Lazy loading can be enabled or disabled in the Admin Center. When it is enabled, external $refs are loaded only when they are required to render a specific operation, for example, when a user expands an operation in API docs. This reduces the API load time and improves the performance. Lazy loading affects the way domain errors are surfaced in the API editor. Learn more. Interactive Docs have a new option to ignore SSL certificate errors for \"try it out\" requests routed via the SwaggerHub proxy. This allows sending requests to servers that use self-signed SSL certificates. The option can be found at the bottom of the Interactive Docs in the SwaggerHub editor. Updated Swagger Editor to v. 3.6.26, which improves autocompletion for OAS3 schema components. Updated Swagger UI to v. 3.22.1, which includes the following improvements: Support for the GFM table syntax in OpenAPI 3.0 descriptions. Support for application\/x-www-form-urlencoded request bodies without explicitly-defined fields. Integration improvements: Integration with Azure DevOps Services (formerly Visual Studio Team Services, or VSTS). Use this integration to push your API definition or the generated client\/server code to a specific Git repository in Azure DevOps Services. The default Azure DevOps organization for integration can be specified in the Admin Center. The TFS Sync integration has been renamed to Azure DevOps Server , and now it also supports OpenAPI 3.0. OpenAPI 3.0 support in the Azure API Management integration. Note: To use the integration for OpenAPI 3.0 definitions, you will need to register an application in Azure that will be used to authenticate requests from SwaggerHub to Azure. For details, see Configuring Azure API Management Integration . The Bitbucket integration now supports project-owned repositories in Bitbucket Server. Support for auto-provisioning GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps Services, and Azure DevOps Server integrations via the SwaggerHub Maven plugin . New regions in the Amazon API Gateway Lambda Sync integration: us-east-2, eu-west-2, eu-west-3, eu-north-1, ap-south-1, cn-north-1, cn-northwest-1, ca-central-1. Other new features and improvements: Organization owners can see member email addresses on the Members page in the organization settings. The account settings have been rearranged into vertical tabs. Updated the code generator to Swagger Codegen v. 3.0.8 (for OpenAPI 3.0 definitions) and v. 2.4.5 (for OpenAPI 2.0). Upgrade notes: The size of the upgrade file for this release is larger than usual (about 130 MB), and it may take some time to upload it to the Admin Center.

"body" : "Configuration improvements: Fixed display of license limits including Designer and Consumer seats. Added diagnostics data to log export for faster responses from the support team. New features and improvements: Added an option to send \"Try-It-Out\" requests directly from the browser to the target server, bypassing the SwaggerHub application. This can be used, for example, to test APIs running on localhost . This option requires CORS support on the API server. Updated the version dropdown for APIs and domains, making it easier to set the default version, create new versions, change the visibility and the published\/unpublished status. Moved the Comments panel adjacent to the editor for improved usability. Added a prompt about unsaved changes when navigating away from the editor. Added Style Validation rules for enforcing the presence of API titles and enforcing every operation to have a 200 response. Added email notifications when a new version is added to an API or domain, and when the API or domain visibility is changed. Improved support for openapi: 3.0.1 . Updated Swagger Editor to v. 3.6.8 and Swagger UI to v. 3.18.1, which include numerous improvements: \"Jump to\" links for models. Support for media type examples ( content.<media-type>.example ) in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions. Note: Plural examples are not supported yet. File upload for multimedia media types ( image\/* , audio\/* , video\/* ) in OpenAPI 3.0 definitions.

You can now send \"try it out\" requests to local network IP addresses, and import definitions from local IPs (except localhost , 127.*.*.* and 172.18.* ). Updated the editor toolbar – consolidated some redundant menus, moved the Save button to a secondary toolbar above the editor panel. Improved mocking of allOf schemas.

Offloading SSL to a load balancer is still supported as an alternative. However, existing customers who use a load balancer will need to update the load balancer port listeners and health checks. See HTTPS Setup Using Load Balancer for the up-to-date information. Proxy support. You can configure a proxy server to be used for outbound connections from SwaggerHub, such as “try it out”, integrations, importing definitions, and other functionality. Admin Center is now accessed without the port number: http(s):\/\/{host}\/ui\/index.html . Ports 81 and 8080 are no longer used. Inbound traffic uses standard port 80 (if no SSL certificate is installed) or 443 (if the certificate is installed and HTTPS is enabled). LDAPS certificate can be deleted if no longer required. Editor improvements: Added a navigation panel on the left that displays all operations and models in the API or domain. You can use it to search for operations, HTTP methods and models, and quickly navigate to their definitions in the editor. Replaced the editor view toggle with a draggable splitter. Improved the “jump to” links in the UI panel: they are now always visible instead of being visible just on hover. Added sorting in the editor validation panel. Arranged editor toolbar buttons in a single row for easier access. Other new features and improvements: Added documentation-only view for APIs and domains. You may share a view-only version of the API documentation using the following links: http(s):\/\/{host}\/apis\/{owner}\/{api-name}\/docs\/{version}\n\nhttp(s):\/\/{host}\/domains\/{owner}\/{domain-name}\/docs\/{version} that is, by adding \/docs\/ between the API (or domain) name and version in URL. Collaborators with Editor permission can now add and remove other collaborators; rename APIs and domains; change API and domain visibility; add, remove, publish and unpublish versions; manage integrations. Added “try it out” support for the Cookie header in requests, including API keys passed in cookies. Updated the code generator to be based on the Swagger Codegen 2.3.1 release version. Updated Swagger Editor to v. 3.6.0 and Swagger UI to v. 3.17.1. These versions include: Support for form data and file upload for OpenAPI 3.0 definitions.

As a result, 1.x instances cannot be upgraded to 2.x directly and migration from 1.x to 2.x is a multi-stage process: Do a fresh install of 2.x Backup your 1.x data Import your data into the 2.x installation Configure new DNS name (if your 2.x instance uses a different DNS name than your 1.x instance) These steps are described in detail below. Considerations The described procedure can migrate data from versions 1.20.1–1.29.x . Customers migrating from earlier versions must first upgrade to the latest 1.x release (but without the Ubuntu 20 migration). We strongly recommend using the same DNS name for the SwaggerHub On-Premise 2.x instance as was used for the 1.x instance. Otherwise, you will need to take extra steps to reflect the new DNS name. Before the migration, read about the differences between 1.x and 2.x . Requirements Admin access to the 1.x instance. If installing 2.x to a Kubernetes cluster: kubectl access to the cluster. If installing 2.x on a VM: SSH access to the VM, with root or sudo privileges. 4. Handle DNS name change (if needed) These steps are needed only if the 2.x instance uses a different DNS name than the 1.x instance. Run the bulk-replace command to replace the old DNS name with the new one in all APIs and domains in the 2.x instance: $ kubectl exec -it deploy\/swaggerhub-operator -n swaggerhub -- cmd bulk-replace old.example.com new.example.com In VM (embedded cluster) installations, the namespace ( -n argument) is default and can be omitted. Update the SwaggerHub DNS name specified in external tools and CI\/CD pipelines: Requests to the Registry API and User Management API . Requests to API mocks . SwaggerHub CLI configuration. Maven plugin configuration. If you use SAML single sign-on, update the Entity ID , Application URL , and Assertion Consumer URL in the SwaggerHub connector in your SAML identity provider. If you use GitHub authentication, update the Application callback URL in the SwaggerHub OAuth application configured in GitHub. If you use Azure API Management integration, update the Redirect URI in the application registered in Azure . Recreate API mocks by triggering the API Auto Mocking integration in all APIs that use it. You can automate this procedure by using SwaggerHub CLI integration commands or the Registry API integration endpoints .

When your upgrade is successfully installed, the version number will be updated. See Also Installing SwaggerHub On-Premise Differences Between SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.x and 2.x " },

Collaborators are SwaggerHub users who can view or edit your API or domain and who can work on it along with you. For example, if you want to share a private API or domain with other users, you can add these users as collaborators. The number of collaborators that can be added to an API or domain depends on the SwaggerHub plan of the API or domain owner. In organization -owned APIs and domains, collaborators can be both individual users and teams . Each member of a team counts as one collaborator. If an API or domain is private , it is accessible only to the owner and collaborators. If an API or domain is public , anyone can view it, but only the owner and collaborators can change it. Concurrent editing You and collaborators can edit the same API definition simultaneously. However, when somebody saves their changes, they can overwrite the changes made by others. To prevent data loss, during editing, SwaggerHub displays a warning every time someone saves their changes to the definition: Also, if somebody changed the API definition while you were editing it, SwaggerHub will warn you before saving your changes: To avoid data loss in this case, we recommend that you save your API to a file and then merge it with the API stored in SwaggerHub. You can merge specifications by using the SwaggerHub Compare and Merge feature, or by using some external merge tool. Also, we recommend that you use comments to coordinate your work with collaborators. See Also Comments Teams " },

If you are disabling TLS, the certs should be removed from the file fields to remove them from the system. These steps are only applicable for a VM (embedded cluster) installation. TLS Certificate - The PEM file containing the TLS certificate. The PEM file should contain the certificate itself along with any required intermediate certificates. The file should have this format: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- certificate 1 -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- certificate 2 -----END CERTIFICATE----- ...

The default directory is the current folder. -n CODEGEN_NAME specifies the name of your custom generator that will be displayed in SwaggerHub’s Export menu. This name must differ from the built-in generator names. You can use this command to see the built-in generator names: java -jar path\/to\/swagger-codegen-cli-VERSION.jar langs -p PACKAGE specifies the package name of your generator class. The default package is io.swagger.codegen . The generated project includes a Java class that implements the generator, sample .mustache templates, pom.xml (Maven configuration file), and a README file. Modify the generator code and .mustache templates to suit your needs. For some tips, see: the project’s README file How to add a generator for a new language or framework Building your own templates Mustache template variables and Differences between Mustache and Handlebars syntax (Optional.) If your code uses custom dependencies not covered by Swagger Codegen, you need to package these dependencies into your final JAR file. You can do this by using the Maven Assembly Plugin . Add the following to the plugins section of your pom.xml : <plugin>\n <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins<\/groupId>\n <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin<\/artifactId>\n <version>3.1.1<\/version>\n <executions>\n <execution>\n <phase>package<\/phase>\n <goals>\n <goal>single<\/goal>\n <\/goals>\n <configuration>\n <descriptorRefs>\n <descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies<\/descriptorRef>\n <\/descriptorRefs>\n <\/configuration>\n <\/execution>\n <\/executions>\n<\/plugin> Build the project by running the following command in the project’s root directory: mvn package This will create the {name}-{version}.jar file (or {name}-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar if the Maven Assembly Plugin is used) in the target subdirectory. This is the file you will need to upload to SwaggerHub. Before uploading your generator to SwaggerHub, test it locally to make sure it works correctly and produces the expected output. In the command below, replace the -l argument with your generator name, -o with the desired output directory, and -i with your API definition path or URL. Use io.swagger.codegen.Codegen if you are testing OpenAPI 2.0 templates with Swagger Codegen 2.x, and io.swagger.codegen.v3.Codegen if you are testing OpenAPI 3.0 templates with Swagger Codegen 3.x. On Mac and *nix: java -cp \/path\/to\/swagger-codegen-cli-VERSION.jar:\/path\/to\/your.jar \\\n io.swagger.codegen.Codegen \\\n -i http:\/\/petstore.swagger.io\/v2\/swagger.yaml \\\n -l CODEGEN_NAME \\\n -o GENERATED_DIR On Windows, use ; instead of : as a separator in the -cp argument, and write the whole command on one line (line breaks are added for readability): java -cp path\\to\\swagger-codegen-cli-VERSION.jar;path\\to\\your.jar\n io.swagger.codegen.Codegen\n -i http:\/\/petstore.swagger.io\/v2\/swagger.yaml\n -l CODEGEN_NAME\n -o GENERATED_DIR " },

"body" : "Initial Configuration This information applies to SwaggerHub On-Premise. Once you deploy the SwaggerHub On-Premise virtual machine and activate your license , you will be taken to the System Configurations page where you can configure SwaggerHub. The initial configuration includes only the minimal required settings: Your company name – The name of the company installing SwaggerHub. In SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.19.2 and later, the company name is used to generate the default organization name. Note that you will be able to rename the default organization later. DNS name for this server – The domain name or IP address assigned to this SwaggerHub instance, for example, swaggerhub.acme.com or 10.0.28.208 . Users will use this domain name or IP address to access SwaggerHub, and the links in email notifications, mocks and elsewhere in the SwaggerHub application will also use this domain or IP. Usually, an IT administrator needs to assign a static IP address to a SwaggerHub VM and, optionally, assign a user-friendly domain name to that IP address. The SwaggerHub installer will attempt to detect the IP address during the installation, so, please make sure the IP address is externally accessible. Port for this server (in v. 1.20.0 and later) – Leave it blank unless you run SwaggerHub On-Premise on VirtualBox in the NAT mode. In the latter case, specify the host’s listening port that corresponds to the VM’s port 80. In SwaggerHub On-Premise v. 1.19.3 and earlier, the port is specified in the DNS name for this server field as host:port . Administrator credentials: Option Description Username for the administrator of the server The admin username. 3 to 20 characters, allowed characters: A..Z a..z 0..9 - _ . Admin password The admin password. 7 - 32 characters long, with at least one lowercase letter and one digit. Admin email address The admin email address for notifications. If you are going to use single sign-on , use the same email address as in your identity provider. An SMTP email server for outgoing email. This is required to invite users and send email notifications. Option Description Notification email address The \"From\" address of email notifications, for example, swaggerhub@YourCompany.com or no-reply@YourCompany.com . Depending on the SMTP service you use, this may need to be a real address verified with the SMTP service provider. For example, Amazon SES requires that you verify the ownership of the From email address or the domain of this address. Notification email sender The \"From\" name used in email notifications. For example, SwaggerHub . SMTP Mail Host The SMTP server used for outbound email from SwaggerHub. For example, smtp.sendgrid.com . SMTP Mail Port The SMTP server port. The typical port numbers are 465 for SSL, 587 for STARTTLS, and 25 for unencrypted (plain) connections. SMTP Username and SMTP Password The username and password used to access the SMTP server. SMTP Protocol The type of the connection to the SMTP server: PLAIN, SSL, TLS (STARTTLS). Please check with your SMTP provider. If you are only trialling and would like to set up a temporary SMTP server, see the temporary SMTP examples . To test the email configuration, click Test Email Config . You will receive an email to the administrator email address in a few minutes. If you do not receive it, make sure the Admin email address is correct and check your junk folder. Send usage data to help improve SwaggerHub – Choose whether to send SwaggerHub On-Premise usage data to SmartBear. You can also disable or enable usage data collection at any time later through the Admin Center. For more information, see Usage Data Collection . Other settings can be configured later in the Admin Center . " },

The certificate must meet these requirements: Your SwaggerHub domain name must match the certificate Common Name (CN) or one of the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries. For example, if you want to host SwaggerHub at https:\/\/swaggerhub.acme.com , then swaggerhub.acme.com must be specified in the certificate CN or SAN, or you can use a wildcard certificate for *.acme.com . CN cannot be an IP address; it must be a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or a wildcard domain. IP addresses can be specified only as SAN entries in the certificate. The certificate and private key must be in the PEM format as shown below. The typical extension is .pem, but it may also be .key (for private keys), .cer, .crt, .cert or other. You can convert your certificate to the PEM format by using OpenSSL tools. The PEM file must contain: the certificate itself, any required intermediate certificates (without the root certificate), the private key (either included in the certificate file or provided in a separate field during certificate uploading). The order of certificates in the PEM file must be such that each one certifies the one before it. If the private key is included in the certificate file, it must be at the end of the file. PEM file example: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\ncertificate contents\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nintermediate certificate 1\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nintermediate certificate 2\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nprivate key (optional)\n-----END PRIVATE KEY----- There must be no blank lines at the beginning and end of the file, and between the -----BEGIN and -----END lines. The private key must be in the PKCS #8 format (beginning with -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ).

Click Test NTP Hosts to verify that the specified NTP hostnames or IP addresses are valid. If an error occurs, see the Troubleshooting section below for tips. Click Save NTP . NTP settings are applied immediately, there is no need to restart the SwaggerHub VM. When NTP is working properly, you should see the Synced status below the Current System Time .

The default directory is the current folder. -n CODEGEN_NAME specifies the name of your custom generator that will be displayed in SwaggerHub’s Export menu. This name must differ from the built-in generator names. You can use this command to see the built-in generator names: java -jar path\/to\/swagger-codegen-cli-VERSION.jar langs -p PACKAGE specifies the package name of your generator class. The default package is io.swagger.codegen . The generated project includes a Java class that implements the generator, sample .mustache templates, pom.xml (Maven configuration file), and a README file. Modify the generator code and .mustache templates to suit your needs. For some tips, see: the project’s README file How to add a generator for a new language or framework Building your own templates Mustache template variables and Differences between Mustache and Handlebars syntax (Optional.) If your code uses custom dependencies not covered by Swagger Codegen, you need to package these dependencies into your final JAR file. You can do this by using the Maven Assembly Plugin . Add the following to the plugins section of your pom.xml : <plugin>\n <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins<\/groupId>\n <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin<\/artifactId>\n <version>3.1.1<\/version>\n <executions>\n <execution>\n <phase>package<\/phase>\n <goals>\n <goal>single<\/goal>\n <\/goals>\n <configuration>\n <descriptorRefs>\n <descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies<\/descriptorRef>\n <\/descriptorRefs>\n <\/configuration>\n <\/execution>\n <\/executions>\n<\/plugin> Build the project by running the following command in the project’s root directory: mvn package This will create the {name}-{version}.jar file (or {name}-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar if the Maven Assembly Plugin is used) in the target subdirectory. This is the file you will need to upload to SwaggerHub. Before uploading your generator to SwaggerHub, test it locally to make sure it works correctly and produces the expected output. In the command below, replace the -l argument with your generator name, -o with the desired output directory, and -i with your API definition path or URL. Use io.swagger.codegen.Codegen if you are testing OpenAPI 2.0 templates with Swagger Codegen 2.x, and io.swagger.codegen.v3.Codegen if you are testing OpenAPI 3.0 templates with Swagger Codegen 3.x.

An administrator and organization owners can invite new users by email, but the users need to sign up themselves to register in SwaggerHub. When a SwaggerHub instance is configured for the first time, it is created along with an administrator user and default organization . The administrator can then log in to the SwaggerHub main application, create organizations, and invite other users by email. User Management API can be used to add users to organizations and assign user roles in an automated way. For example: curl -X POST http(s):\/\/SERVER\/api\/user-management\/v1\/orgs\/ORG_NAME\/members \\\n -H 'Authorization: API_KEY' \\\n -H 'Content-Type: application\/json' \\\n -d '{ \"members\": [ \\\n { \"email\": \"jack@example.com\", \"role\": \"CONSUMER\" }, \\\n { \"email\": \"amy@example.com\", \"role\": \"DESIGNER\" } \\\n ]}' The request must be authenticated using the SwaggerHub API key of the administrator user or an organization owner. Administrators can add users to any organization in the system. Users can also create accounts by clicking Sign Up on the SwaggerHub home page. If single sign-on is configured, users can just log in to SwaggerHub using their account in the identity provider. (The users must already exist in the identity provider.) A user account will be created in SwaggerHub when a user logs in via SSO for the first time. All users who sign up for SwaggerHub or log in to SwaggerHub via SSO for the first time automatically join the default organization as Consumers. This means that they can only view APIs and domains created under the default organization and cannot create their own APIs, domains, and organizations and invite other users. See Sharing APIs for details. An organization owner can add members, and they can then invite new members by email if they have roles other than Consumers . If users share APIs , they can invite new users by email to become collaborators for that API. Which users need a license seat? Designers who will create and edit API definitions need a license. Consumers of private APIs need a license. Consumers who wish to comment on public APIs need a license. Consumers who only need to view public APIs (without commenting) do not need a license. They can view public APIs directly without creating a user account. See Also Viewing All Users Deleting Users Single Sign-On - Overview " },

In the general case, SwaggerHub usernames may differ from LDAP logon names specified by the User ID option. For example, a LDAP user who logs in as jsmith might see John_Smith as the username in SwaggerHub. For most Active Directory installations, this should be sAMAccountName . Other LDAP providers may have similar fields with other names, such as uid or cn . Note that LDAP field names are case-sensitive . To use multiple LDAP fields, separate them with commas: givenName, sn . The values of these fields will be concatenated using underscores to create a SwaggerHub username (more on that below). When a LDAP user logs in to SwaggerHub for the first time, a SwaggerHub username is generated as follows: The values of the specified Profile name fields are concatenated with an underscore as a delimiter. Characters other than A..Z a..z 0..9 _ . - are replaced with underscores _ . The username is trimmed so that it begins and ends with a letter or number. If the username already exists, a number is appended at the end (2, 3, …) until the username is unique. Example 1 Consider a user with the following LDAP fields: sAMAccountName: jsmith\nuserPricinalName: jsmith@company.com\ncn: Jane Smith\ngivenName: Jane\nsn: Smith\ndisplayName: Jane D.

LDAP displayName SwaggerHub Username Comments John Smith John_Smith John_Smith John_Smith2 Since the John_Smith user already exists in SwaggerHub, the new user becomes John_Smith2 . John~Smith John_Smith3 Similarly, number 3 is appended to make the username unique. Mr. John Smith Jr.!

"body" : "FAQ This information applies to SwaggerHub On-Premise. For SwaggerHub SaaS, click here . Which identity providers does SwaggerHub On-Premise support for single sign-on? SwaggerHub On-Premise currently supports: Okta Active Directory OpenLDAP (since SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.18.8) GitHub If you are considering another identity provider, please contact SmartBear Support . Do I need to create the users in SwaggerHub beforehand? No. SwaggerHub supports just-in-time user provisioning, which means the users will be created in SwaggerHub automatically the first time they log in via SSO. Can SSO help limit the users who can access SwaggerHub and consume a license? If you use LDAP – SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.18.0 and later allow you to limit access to specific LDAP user groups. If you use SAML, this depends on your identity provider (IdP). Some IdPs (like Okta) let you limit application access to specific users and groups. Check with your IdP to learn if it supports this. Can SSO control user roles inside SwaggerHub (such as view-only access to a specific API definition)? Not at this time. Does SSO for SwaggerHub support SCIM? Not at this time. What happens to existing users, user permissions and API definitions if we migrate from internal authentication to SSO or vice versa? All the users, user permissions and data are preserved. However, you may need to migrate existing users to SSO or to internal authentication. If migrating from internal authentication to SSO: Make sure the existing users (including the admin user) have the same email addresses as in your IdP. If needed, ask the users to update their email addresses in SwaggerHub to match their IdP email addresses. In versions prior to 1.20.1, after you enable SSO, you need to run a maintenance script to migrate the existing users to SSO . Internal users that have not been migrated will become inactive. They will not be able to access SwaggerHub and will not count towards the license user limit. Their APIs and domains are preserved though and can be used by other users. In later versions, the existing users are migrated to SSO automatically. If migrating from SSO to internal authentication: Each user will have to set a SwaggerHub password by using the Forgot Login Info? link on the SwaggerHub login page. Then the users can continue accessing SwaggerHub by using their username and password. Can we change the SAML identity provider used with SwaggerHub? Yes, as long as the users keep the same email address, they will be able to access their existing accounts. However, if a user has a different email address in the new IdP, a new user account will be created in SwaggerHub. Is it possible to remove SSO users from SwaggerHub? For example, if a user was removed from the SSO provider. This is possible in SwaggerHub On-Premise 1.18.4 and later – an administrator can delete registered users on the License page of the Admin Center . If you use an earlier version, consider upgrading, or contact SmartBear Support for assistance in removing SSO users. How do I use the SwaggerHub API when SSO is enabled? SwaggerHub Registry API uses API keys for authentication, it does not use SSO. The API does not care which authentication type your SwaggerHub instance uses. Users can get API keys in their user settings in SwaggerHub. See Also Single Sign-On - Overview Troubleshooting Single Sign-On in SwaggerHub On-Premise " },

How to get the macro in your Confluence installation To install the macro, go to Atlassian Marketplace . Download the plugin and install it. How to embed an API into a Confluence page To insert the SwaggerHub Integration for Confluence macro into a page, click on the + (insert) command in Confluence and type \"swagger\" into the Search box. Click on the SwaggerHub Integration for Confluence in the list and the macro will be inserted. The macro dialog behaves like other Confluence macros. Simply fill in the values and click the Insert button to insert an API definition. Specify the type of API definition: OpenAPI or AsyncAPI . Enter the API to be embedded. You can do this two ways: Import the API definition into Confluence by pasting the API file into the API Definition field at the top right of the dialog OR dragging and dropping a file into the Upload area at the right – If you import in this way, you must re-import the API when you make changes. Enter a URL in the API > URL field in the left column – if you link a URL in this way, changes to the API will be re-loaded into your Confluence page whenever a user reloads the page. Specify the Access Token\/API Key or access credentials for the API (if required). How to get an API token For protected APIs that you have access to, you can get an API key from SwaggerHub and use it to access protected API definitions. To retrieve an API key, go to Settings > API Keys in SwaggerHub. You can then generate an API key which can be entered in the API Key field. How to reference a SwaggerHub API definition by its URL Your SwaggerHub API definitions can be accessed through this pattern: https:\/\/api.swaggerhub.com\/apis\/{owner}\/{api}\/{version} If you are using SwaggerHub on-premise, your SwaggerHub API definitions can be accessed through this pattern: http(s):\/\/SERVER\/v1\/apis\/{owner}\/{api}\/{version} If your on-premise installation of SwaggerHub is airgapped or behind a firewall, you may need to contact tech support to figure out how to embed your APIs using this Confluence macro. Specifying OpenAPI options For OpenAPI files you will have the following options. Specifying AsyncAPI options For AsyncAPI files you will have the following options. Embedding the API into the page Once you have specified the desired options, click on Insert to embed the API definition into your Confluence page. Working with embedded APIs Once your API is embedded, the controls are simple and standard. Use the v control to expand items and the ^ control to collapse items. " },

Prerequisites This guide assumes a OpenShift cluster has been prepared as specified in the Minimum Requirements . All commands assume a jumpbox with connectivity to the cluster. OpenShift CLI must be installed. The kubectl binary included with the OpenShift CLI must also be installed. Installing with namespace-scoped access By default the installer assumes that your user has the cluster-admin role at the cluster level. Alternatively, you can install with namespace-scoped access if your user only has cluster-admin access on a single project. Be aware that installing without cluster-scoped access limits some functionality: Without access to cluster-scoped resources, some preflight checks will not be able to run. These tools continue to function, but return less data. Support bundles will only be able to collect limited information. The admin console \"Snapshots\" feature will not work because the admin console can't access the velero namespace. The kubectl kots velero ensure-permissions command can be used to create additional Roles and RoleBindings to allow the necessary cross-namespace access.

The example below will show how to tunnel from the administrator’s desktop to the jumpbox VM using SSH, which will then open port 8800 to reach the administrator console. General example to tunnel from the administrator’s desktop: ssh -i id_rsa -L 8800:localhost:8800 user@jump_box " },

"body" : "This section of the documentation is for users of SwaggerHub On-Premise. It explains features that are unique to SwaggerHub On-Premise. SwaggerHub On-Premise has less frequent releases than SwaggerHub and as a result, new features are not always available immediately. In addition, SwaggerHub is a SaaS system where there are no version numbers and changes can be made instantly available to all users. By contrast, SwaggerHub On-Premise releases require that your system administrator download an update and install it on your own servers. Differences in feature availability are noted throughout the docs. Check our support policy for instructions on how to determine your current version. The Release Notes provide details on the current version and what features are available in the latest release. In This Section Account Settings SwaggerHub uses SmartBear ID that allows users to access SmartBear products from a single account. SwaggerHub On-Premise is installed on your own server, often inside a firewall or airgapped, so it cannot access an Internet-based credentialling system. " }
